# Monastery

Light modeling for MongoDB (using [monk](http://github.com/learnboost/monk)).

You're probably face palming yourself, wondering "why... oh why another mongodb model library?". Read on.

## Goals

- Simple and flexible modeling;
- Light codebase (just enough LOC, comprehensible, etc.);
- No schema lock-in (they're just there to ensure the right type of data gets written);
- Prototypal inheritance.

## Install

`npm install monastery`

## `Model`

### Initialize

Create a connection to the database and get the Model constructor by requiring `monastery`.

```javascript
var Monastery = require("monastery")("localhost/db_name");
  , Model = Monastery.Model;
```

### Defining a `Model`

```javascript
var User = new Model("users");
```

Your `Model` works like a normal JavaScript object instance: prototypal inheritance.

```
User.prototype.firstName = function(){
  return this.name.split(" ")[0];
}
```

### Schema

You may pass a schema as second argument when constructing a `new Model`. This will cast the provided data in the right type when saving to MongoDB.

```javacript
var User = new Model("users", {
    email: String
  , name: String
  , password_hash: String

  , created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});
```

*Note: As opposed to mongoose, schemas are not enforced. With an instance, you may add or remove any field present or not in the schema. Schemas' only use is typecasting.*

#### Embedded documents

You may define embedded documents' schema just like you'd define a `Model`'s schema.

```javascript
var Post = new Model("posts", {
    title: String
  , slug: String

  , author: Model.ObjectID

  , comments: [{
        author: Model.ObjectID
      , content: String
      , created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
    }]

  , likes: [Model.ObjectID] // Casts any value in there as a MongoDB ObjectID
})
```

The documents will be casted according to your schema.

### Inheritance

If you need models that are extensions of a more general model, you can inherit from another `Model` by using `Model.prototype.inherits`:

```javascript
var Doc = new Model("docs", {
  comments: Array
  author: Model.ObjectId
});

var Article = new Model("docs", {
  _type: "article"
}).inherits(Doc);
```

*Note: Hooks are not inherited.*

### Inserting

```javascript
User.insert({

    email: john@doe.com
  , name: "John Doe"
  , password: "password123" // Just use `bcrypt`, example below...

}, function(error, user) {
  // user instanceof User => true
  console.log(user.firstName()); // => "John"
});
```

### Finding, updating, removing, etc.

`find`, `findOne`, `findById`, `update`, `findAndModify`, `remove` are all inherited from [monk](http://github.com/learnboost/monk) and they all send back an instance of your `Model`.

Furthermore, they also all return a `promise`, just like monk.

## Instances of your models

`var user = new User()`

### save(callback)

Inserts or updates your instance (based on the presence or not of the key `_id`).

```javascript
user.save(function(error){
  // user inserted in the database
  // typeof user._id !== "undefined"

  user.newProperty = "this is a new property";
  user.save(function(error){
    // user has been updated
  });
});
```

### update(query, callback)

Updates your instance with the supplied `query`. It uses the collection's `update` method so **don't forget to use `$set`!**

It will not update your instance in memory, only in the database.

```javascript
user.update({$set: {newField: "test"}}, function(error, updated){
  // updated === true
  // user.newField === undefined
});
```

### reload(callback)

Reloads the current instance from the database.

```javascript
user.reload(function(error){
  // user.newField === "test"
});
```

### remove(callback)

Removes your instance from the database. Note that your instance of `User` is still filled with data, it just has its `_id` removed. Therefore you could reinsert it by using `save`.

```javascript
user.remove(function(error){
  // typeof user._id === "undefined"
});
```

## Hooks

A hook is a mechanism to perform some actions or alter some data before or after some event. Hooks are all asynchronous and therefore must call the provided callback. Available hooks are: "load", "insert", "update" and "remove".

Actually **useful** example of a parallel hook:

```javascript
User.before("insert", function(next, done){
  next(); // calls the next function in the hook's queue immediatly
  bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10, function(error, hash){
    if (error)
      return done(error);

    this.password_hash = hash;
    delete this.password; // You wouldn't want to store that!
    done();
  });
});
```

You should pass an error to the callback if there is one. The operations will be alted.

### Sync

Hooks can be sync (and will run one after the other).

```javascript
User.before("insert", function(){
  this.prop = "some property value";
});
```

Example with an error:

```javascript
User.before("remove", function isNotAnAdmin(){
  return this.isAdmin !== true;
});
```

### Async

Hooks can be async and will still run one after the other. Use a callback in your function like so:

```javascript
User.after("remove", function(done){
  Post.remove({author: this._id}, done);
});
```

### Async and parallel

Hooks can be called in parallel. **You need to use two callback for those to work!**

```javascript
User.before("insert", function(next, done){
  // Call `next` whenever you want the next hook to start working
  next(); // the next hook will start doing its thing right away.
  somethingAsync(done);
});
```

### Available hooks (before and after)

- "load": the schema is applied (with `new User()`);
- "insert": the instance is inserted in the database;
- "remove": the instance is removed from the database;

## Validation

See "hooks".

`monastery` provides the basic structures for the most flexibility. Hooks are all you need for validation.

```javascript
var requireName = function(){
  if (typeof this.name === "undefined")
    throw new Error("Name is required");
}

User.before("insert", requireName);

User.before("insert", function(next){
  checkSomethingAsync(this, function(error, result){
    if (error)
      return next(new Error("Something when wrong when checking something async"));
    else if (!result)
      return next(new Error("No result when checking something async"));
    else {
      this.checkedAsynchronously = true;
      next();
    }
  });
});
```

Returning `false` in a sync hook will halt the hook's queue. It will then call your callback with an error;

If an error is thrown within a sync hook, it will halt the chain of hooks and your callback will be called with it as a first argument.

If an error is passed as first argument to a callback of an async hook, same thing will happen.

```javascript
User.insert({}, function(error, user){
  // error.message === "Name is required";
});
```
